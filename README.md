# OctoIntents

## üåâ Project Overview

This project introduces a trust-minimized cross-chain interoperability framework that unifies the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems using:

- **Cross-chain intents (ERC-7683)**
- **Hyperlane interchain messaging**
- **Custom Dutch auction-based solver mechanism**

It enables seamless and efficient token bridging between heterogeneous testnets like **Ethereum Sepolia**, **Rootstock**, and **Citrea**, while optimizing for **capital efficiency**, **decentralization**, and **settlement speed**.

## üîÅ How It Works ‚Äì End-to-End Flow

1. **User Opens Intent (Deposits Tokens to Escrow on Chain C1)**  
   A user deposits tokens to an ERC-7683-compliant escrow on Chain C1 (e.g., Sepolia). This creates a formal intent describing the desired action.

2. **Intent Message Dispatched via Hyperlane**  
   Intent metadata is securely dispatched from C1 to C2 using **Hyperlane Mailbox**, ensuring trustless cross-chain communication.

3. **Dutch Auction Starts on Chain C2**  
   Upon receipt, a **Dutch auction** is initiated on Chain C2. The price starts high and linearly decreases until accepted.

4. **Solver Selection via Dutch Auction**  
   The first solver to accept the current price wins the auction and locks in the right to fulfill the intent.

5. **Solver Executes and Fulfills Intent**  
   The winning solver delivers the requested tokens to the user on Chain C2.

6. **Escrow Settlement on Chain C1**  
   The solver provides proof of fulfillment. Once verified, the escrow on Chain C1 releases funds to the solver.

## üß† Why This Matters

### ‚ùå Traditional Bridging Issues

- Hours of wait time post-settlement
- Limited solver participation
- High trust assumptions and opaque systems

### ‚úÖ Our Solution

- Trustless, escrow-enforced fulfillment
- Decentralized solver market via open auctions
- Near-instant post-verification settlements

### üìä Capital Efficiency with Dutch Auctions

- Traditional bridges lock large liquidity for hours
- Our approach enables solver settlement every **minute**, reducing required liquidity by **60x**
  - From ~$800K ‚Üí ~$13.5K for the same transaction throughput

## üß± Architecture Breakdown

### 1. Intent Creation & Escrow (Chain C1)

- User deposits into an ERC-7683 escrow contract
- Escrow holds funds while awaiting cross-chain fulfillment

### 2. Cross-Chain Intent Dispatch (Hyperlane)

- Intent dispatched using Hyperlane Mailbox + Messenger
- Enables programmable, secure intent routing across chains

### 3. Dutch Auction-Based Solver Selection (Chain C2)

- Auctions start high, decay linearly
- First solver to accept the price wins
- Fair, decentralized, and dynamic pricing

### 4. Solver Fulfillment & Final Settlement

- Solver sends tokens to user on Chain C2
- Provides fulfillment proof to Chain C1
- Escrow verifies and pays solver

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notable Engineering Wins

- **Dutch Auction Solver System**  
  Per-intent auction contracts with price decay to encourage real-time solver competition.

- **Manual Hyperlane Deployment**  
  Full Hyperlane deployment on Rootstock Testnet to enable messaging in low-infra testnets.

- **Manual Message Relay**  
  Used CLI to manually relay intent messages across chains, proving robust E2E flow.

## üìà Capital Efficiency Advantage

- With minute-level settlement, solvers only need ~$13.5K inventory vs ~$800K (if paid hourly)
- This enables 60x better capital utilization
